                <h3>Advanced Hackathon 2020 - Wards MyWorkplace App</h3>
                <p>
                  I took part in the 2020 Advanced Hackathon, in which the task
                  was to create an external applet which integrates with one of
                  our existing applications. I worked as developer on our team,
                  alongside some of the developers for CareNotes. We created an
                  applet that integrates with CareNotes, a patient management
                  system, to show patients on a ward, and record incidents,
                  clinical notes, BMI and Bodymap forms against the patient.
                  This would then use the existing CareNotes API to send this to
                  CareNotes. The project was designed and built in 24 hours, in
                  Advanced's MosaicJS framework. I created the modals, forms and
                  bodymapping functionality. The project is being looked into
                  further as something we can develop into a full product.

                <h3>Tabletop Simulator - Gloomhaven Scripting</h3>
                <p>
                  I have been working to make board games playable in Tabletop
                  Simulator, so that people can continue playing during the
                  Covid-19 outbreak. I created a fork of the Gloomhaven Fantasy
                  set-up mod, and scripted all of the Forgotten Circles
                  expansion and solo scenarios in lua with

                    >Curtis Reet</a
                  >. My mod has now been merged into the original mod, where I
                  have been credited, which is the most popular tabletop
                  simulator mod with over 100,000 active users

                  I was the original leader on the Portal 2 mod Portal Stores:
                  Mel. The mod went on to win a Video Game Award for "Best Fan
                  Creation" in 2015, and has been given a full steam release,
                  with overwhelmingly positive reviews. I am in the credits of
                  the mod for my past contributions.

                <h3>Minecraft VR Nightclub - Scripted Beat Detection</h3>
                <p>
                  I host a Minecraft server for VR users. The server is a
                  nightclub for VR users, and features a custom scripted beat
                  detection system. The beat detection uses a C application,
                  which acts as the API, using the GBD Framework. In the game, I
                  have used the Computercraft Mod, to make a lua application
                  which gets the beat information from the API, which keeps the
                  lights in sync with the music. The club was created as a
                  meeting place for people during Covid-19.
