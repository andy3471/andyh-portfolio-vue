          LunchRota is a ground up rewrite of an application that was created
          for our service desk by
          <a href="https://curtisreet.co.uk" title="CurtPortfolio"
            >Curtis Reet</a
          >. The application is to be used by teams, in order to keep track of
          daily work roles, as well as claim available lunch slots. The original
          application was built on PHP5, and required further development, so I
          decided to rewrite this in Laravel to allow me to continue working on
          the application
        </p>
        <p>
          The roles can be assigned to users either via a UI built with VueJS,
          or uploaded via CSV.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site can be configured to either use a set number of available
          lunch slots, or be calculated using the number of user roles that are
          marked as 'available'. This is used, for example, if certain roles
          need to be on the phones, and you require a certain number of people
          who are on phones to be available at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          LunchRota contains a full admin panel for editing users, lunch slots,
          roles and user roles. These use a Vue JS interface, to allow you to
          bulk edit.
