          Hi, I'm Andrew Hargrave. I'm a self taught Web Developer that works
          with PHP, JS, HTML, SQL (MySQL and MS SQL), Redis, CSS and SCSS. I
          have a very good knowledge of the Laravel MVC framework, and have used
          it for multiple personal projects. I use VueJS for as a front-end
          JavaScript framework primarily, and have released multiple components
          that can be used freely in any Vue web app. I also have knowledge of
          Bootstrap and Bulma as UI frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently employed as an Applications Support Anaylst at Neilson
          Finance Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I was employed as an Application Delivery Specialist at
          Advanced, the UK's third largest software company. I worked in the
          Health & Care business unit with Carenotes, an ASP.NET Web
          Application, with a large number of SOA services. Carenotes is used
          widely by the NHS for mental health and community Trusts. I provide
          third line support for Carenotes, as well as deploy and upgrade it.
          Carenotes is hosted on Windows Servers with IIS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a strong knowledge of Linux and Apache, and host multiple
          web applications on Linux Servers. I host web applications and video
          game servers privately, which is running on virtualised servers using
          Proxmox hypervisor, as well as in Docker Containers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of web development and deployment, I like to work on music in
          my free time, using Analog Synthesizers. I'm also a huge fan of board
          games and virtual reality.
